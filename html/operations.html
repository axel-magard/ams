        <li><b>Cycle Time</b>: duration of that operation</li>
        <li><b>Split/Join Factor</b>: can be used to define that multiple parts will be created for one incoming part at that operation (Split/Join Factor > 1), or multiple incoming parts will be put together to form one parts leaving that operation (Split/Join Factor < 1).</li>
        <li><b>Workcenter</b>: Workcenter this operation is assigned to</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the following cost and resource specific attributes can be defined:</p>
